# AlgoSurg

This GitHub repository contains the documentation for the AlgoSurg Assignment. You can find the relevant code within the uploaded Jupyter Notebook file, which includes markdown explanations for each code cell. I synthesized a dataset comprising simple shape images and masks. Then, I designed and trained a CNN model for segmentation, assessing key metrics and conducting inference on validation images. Along with this I have also uploaded a detailed documentation explaining the code and the training metrics as well.
