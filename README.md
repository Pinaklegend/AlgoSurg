# AlgoSurg

This GitHub repository contains the documentation for the AlgoSurg Assignment. You can find the relevant code within the uploaded Jupyter Notebook file(ProSpace-AlgoSurg), which includes markdown explanations for each code cell. I synthesized a dataset comprising simple shape images and masks. Then, I designed and trained a CNN model for segmentation, assessing key metrics and conducting inference on validation images. Along with this I have also uploaded a detailed documentation explaining the code and the training metrics as well. It is a docx file, u can view it raw or download it

I also worked on a project where I implemented a pre-made model for image segmentation and blurring. This project aimed to simulate the bokeh effect, which refers to the pleasing blur seen in out-of-focus areas of a photograph. The effect is characterized by soft, circular shapes created by points of light, enhancing the visual appeal of images. You can refer to the ipynb file (Image_Segmentation_Project) for the code and documentation file for the final,blurred output.
